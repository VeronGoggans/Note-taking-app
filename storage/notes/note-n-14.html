    i'm feeling deeper in the cycle all i'm feeling is a reaper 
    soul slipping every demon untill the mouth of this creture 
    I created can't maintain it I just blame it on the demons.
    for the reasons can I reason with a man who don't believe me 
    <br>
    <br>
    Anything anymore for trying all this, i'm feeling fine, just for tonight 
    I'm so alone, i'm addictied to, my whole life I spawn the demons and I can't rely
