<h2>Lyrics</h2><div><div class="paragraph"><p>i'm sliping deeper in the cycle all i'm fearing is the reaper&nbsp;</p><p>soul slipping ever deeper untill the mouth of this creature&nbsp;</p><p>I created can't maintain it I just blame it on the demons.</p><p>for the reasons can I reason with a man who don't believe in</p><p><br></p><p>Anything anymore for trying all this, i'm feeling fine, popped a perc tonight&nbsp;</p><p>I'll sober up, i'm addictied to, my whole life I spawn the demons in the candle light.</p></div><br><br></div>
