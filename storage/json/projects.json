If you have the flexibility to design the API, using the GET method and including the relevant data as query parameters in the URL is a more conventional and widely accepted approach.\n\nUsing POST for retrieval is not inherently wrong, but it could be confusing for developers who expect GET requests to be used for data retrieval. Additionally, it might not be immediately clear to others working with your API that the request is meant for retrieval rather than creating or modifying data, which is the more common use case for POST.",
